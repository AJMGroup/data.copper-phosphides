## Paper abstract

Using first principles structure searching we identify a novel *Fm-3m* phase of Cu2P and two low-lying metastable structures, an *I43d*-Cu3P phase, and a *Cm*-Cu3P11 phase. Pair distribution functions of the novel *Cm*-Cu3P11 phase show its structural similarity to the experimentally identified *Cm*-Cu2P7 phase. The relative stability of all Cu-P phases at finite temperatures is determined by calculating the Gibbs Free energy using vibrational effects from phonon modes at 0 K. From this, a finite-temperature convex hull is created, on which *Fm-3m*-Cu2P is dynamically stable and the Cu(3-x)P (x<<2) defect phase *Cmc2_1*-Cu8P3 remains metastable (within 10 meV/atom of the convex hull) across a temperature range from 0 K to 600 K. Both CuP2 and Cu3P exhibit theoretical gravimetric capacities higher than contemporary graphite anodes. The predicted Cu2P composition has a theoretical gravimetric capacity of 508 mAh/g as a Li-ion battery electrode, greater than both Cu3P (363 mAh/g) and graphite (372 mAh/g). Cu2P is also predicted to be both non-magnetic and metallic, which should promote efficient electron transfer in the anode. Cu2P's favorable properties as a metallic, high capacity material suggest its use as a future conversion anode for Li-ion batteries; with a volume expansion of 99% during complete cycling, Cu2P anodes could be more durable than other conversion anodes in the Cu-P system with volume expansions greater than 150%.
